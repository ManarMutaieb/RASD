# About this project
"RASD" is a mobile application that has been developed to detect traffic violations with the help of a driver's dashcam. The app is designed to generate a readymade report that can be used to report the violation to the authorities. The application supports both English and Arabic languages to cater to a wider audience. With the help of the app, drivers can easily report any violations they witness on the road, which in turn can help in making the roads safer.
